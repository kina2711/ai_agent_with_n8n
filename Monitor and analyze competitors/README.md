# AI-Agent with n8n Automation: Competitor Monitoring & Analysis

This project implements an autonomous agent—powered by Large Language Models—that continuously tracks, collects, and interprets intelligence on your competitors using n8n’s no-code/low-code workflows.

## Key Features

* **Automated Data Collection**: Scrapes competitor websites, social media feeds, job boards, and public APIs on a defined schedule.

* **Intelligent Insight Extraction**: Uses AI prompts to distill raw data into meaningful insights—trend detection, product feature comparisons, pricing shifts, and sentiment analysis.

* **Dynamic Workflow Orchestration**: n8n nodes handle conditional logic, error retries, and multi-step pipelines (e.g., fetch → parse → classify → store).

* **Custom Alerts & Reports**: Generates and distributes summary reports (via email) whenever significant competitor moves are detected.

* **Extensible & Configurable**: Easily add new data sources or analysis modules by dragging in n8n nodes and tweaking a few parameters.

## Technologies Used

* **n8n**: Orchestration of triggers, HTTP requests, and conditional branches without writing boilerplate code.

* **OpenAI API (GPT-4)**: Natural-language understanding for parsing press releases, blog posts, and social chatter.

* **Database & Storage**: PostgreSQL (or MongoDB) for structured logs; S3 (or similar) for archival of raw snapshots.

* **Notifications**: Slack/Webhook, email SMTP, or Google Workspace integration for report delivery.

## Benefits

* **Real-Time Competitive Edge**: Never miss a product launch, price change, or hiring spike.

* **Reduced Manual Work**: Replace piecemeal scripts and one-off dashboards with a unified, maintainable automation.

* **Actionable Intelligence**: Move from data overload to concise, AI-curated insights you can act on immediately.
